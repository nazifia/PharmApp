# Dispensing Log and Stock Check Updates

## Summary of Changes Made

### 1. Dispensing Log Logic Modifications

#### **Problem Solved:**
- Regular users (non-superusers, non-admins, non-managers) could only see their own dispensing logs
- Users wanted all regular users to see dispensing logs for all users while maintaining statistics logic

#### **Changes Made:**

**File: `pharmapp/store/views.py`**

1. **`dispensing_log` view (lines 2270-2275):**
   - Changed from user-specific filtering to showing all logs for all users
   - Maintained permission checking for admin/manager privileges
   - All users can now see all dispensing logs

2. **`dispensing_statistics` view (lines 2375-2382):**
   - Updated to allow all users to see all logs
   - Maintained daily/searched date total amount calculations
   - Statistics still respect date and search filters

3. **`user_dispensing_summary` view (lines 4261-4267):**
   - Modified to show all logs to all users
   - Regular users can't filter by specific users (admin/manager privilege)
   - Maintained existing statistics calculations

4. **`user_dispensing_details` view (lines 4347-4389):**
   - Updated to show all dispensing logs to all users
   - Regular users see all users in dropdown but can't filter by them
   - Maintained existing filtering and statistics logic

#### **Template Changes:**
- **`pharmapp/templates/store/dispensing_log.html`** already had proper conditional logic
- User filter dropdown only shows for admins/managers (`{% if can_view_all_users %}`)
- Regular users see all logs but can't filter by specific users

#### **Result:**
✅ **All authenticated users can now see all dispensing logs**
✅ **Statistics calculations remain unchanged (daily/searched date totals)**
✅ **Admin/Manager privileges maintained for user filtering**
✅ **Existing functionality preserved**

### 2. Stock Check Report Delete Functionality

#### **Problem Solved:**
- No delete functionality existed for stock check reports (both retail and wholesale)
- Users needed ability to delete stock check reports while maintaining existing functionalities

#### **Changes Made:**

**File: `pharmapp/store/views.py`**

1. **Added `delete_stock_check` view (lines 3514-3530):**
   - Requires `can_manage_inventory` permission
   - Only allows deletion of pending/in_progress stock checks
   - Prevents deletion of completed stock checks
   - Provides success/error messages

**File: `pharmapp/wholesale/views.py`**

2. **Added `delete_wholesale_stock_check` view (lines 2934-2953):**
   - Same permission and status checks as retail version
   - Handles wholesale stock check deletion
   - Maintains existing functionality

**File: `pharmapp/store/urls.py`**

3. **Added URL pattern (line 66):**
   ```python
   path('delete/<int:stock_check_id>/', views.delete_stock_check, name='delete_stock_check'),
   ```

**File: `pharmapp/wholesale/urls.py`**

4. **Added URL pattern (line 58):**
   ```python
   path('delete-wholesale-stock-check/<int:stock_check_id>/', views.delete_wholesale_stock_check, name='delete_wholesale_stock_check'),
   ```

#### **Template Changes:**

**File: `pharmapp/templates/store/stock_check_list.html`**

5. **Updated Actions column (lines 26-37):**
   - Added styled "View Report" button
   - Added "Delete" button with confirmation dialog
   - Delete button only shows for non-completed stock checks
   - Includes CSRF protection

**File: `pharmapp/templates/wholesale/wholesale_stock_check_list.html`**

6. **Updated Actions column (lines 26-37):**
   - Same changes as retail version
   - Consistent styling and functionality

#### **Security Features:**
✅ **Permission-based access** (`can_manage_inventory` required)
✅ **Status validation** (only pending/in_progress can be deleted)
✅ **Confirmation dialogs** to prevent accidental deletion
✅ **CSRF protection** on all delete forms
✅ **Proper error handling** and user feedback

#### **Result:**
✅ **Users can delete stock check reports (retail and wholesale)**
✅ **Only authorized users can delete (inventory managers)**
✅ **Completed stock checks are protected from deletion**
✅ **All existing functionalities maintained**
✅ **Consistent UI/UX across retail and wholesale**
